It‚Äôs her body and she should make the choice of allowing the baby to continue or terminate. There are certain circumstances where the woman's health is at risk because of the pregnancy. That's when the abortion should be practiced. A brain-dead fetus would cause complications. There are other situations where a rape victim gets pregnant. It's more common than believed. When that happens an abortion should be an option. Even at young ages like 11 or 12. It'll usually have long-term effects both physically and emotionally. Fundamentally, I'm saying that, under the circumstances of rape, the girl should get an abortion. There are less severe situations where the girl willingly got pregnant and realized that she's not prepared enough to take care of the baby. There are situations like that where the young girl is firm in the belief of abortion because that'll help her until she's prepared. A young girl in a situation like that would need an abortion because they know what will happen if they keep the baby. It will make things difficult. All in all, a woman should have the right to request an abortion (unless the fetus is at the stage of when it can live well without a womb) because it's her choice, the baby's health, mental health of the mother, preparedness to experience parenthood, and the fact that it's not like the pro-life movement is doing anything beneficial to keep her. India is an example. All the abortion illegal and strictness against the procedures is just leading to a dramatic rise in dangerous, illegal back-alley abortions. It's not beneficial for the mother nor the baby. I restate that a woman should have the choice of keeping or terminating the baby because 1. It may serve as a population control 2.

       "    \"It should never be illegal because forcing someone to give birth against their will is a heinous violation of their bodily autonomy. Reproduction is an extremely invasive and risky process that carries with it substantial changes to the body and long-term health risks. Therefore, no one should ever be forced to go through that process against their will nor suffer the many risks imposed by it on their health and well-being. Any person who is denied the right to make the most fundamental decisions about their own health and well-being, including the right to say what is imposed on their body, is nothing more than a human slave. And nobody has the right to use someone else's body and health to meet their needs and sustain their life. That's not what human rights are all about. Human rights always belong to human persons, never to parts of those bodies. So, even if a fetus were a person (which it's not because inception is a gradual process, like growing up, and a person can live outside of the womb), it would never be entitled to be sustained by someone else's organs against that person's will because that's not what human rights are all about. Some proponents of forced pregnancy argue that people lose rights to bodily autonomy when they're pregnant because pregnancies always involve two bodies. But, my right to bodily autonomy is preserved even when it conflicts with somebody's right to live. If I need a kidney and somebody else is the only match, my right to life does not guarantee that person's kidney. As a matter of fact, it is never legally permissible to demand the forced use of someone's body to sustain another's life, even if that use is as simple as donating a kidney. You can never be legally forced to donate blood, a kidney or even to give birth. So, pregnancy does not disqualify the right to bodily sovereignty. In conclusion, no one should ever be legally forced to give birth against their will, no matter the stage of their pregnancy.\",\n",

Times have changed pretty dramatically over the last week. No matter how much I mentally prepared myself or how much goodwill I might still Have in him, I just don‚Äôt believe a Wall Street moderate is the person you want leading the country right now. I‚Äôll vote for him in the general election, but that will be far from an enthusiastic decision. It would feel more like choosing between unfair options. I can‚Äôt be a hypocrite. I have a fear that another four years of Trump will divide the country to the point of no return, and I do not disagree with those who take a scorched earth position on Biden....though I think they are being impractical and even a little childish. I just don‚Äôt have faith yet that we can do something really transformative to our government. All humans are flawed and will get pulled by the systems they exist in. It is a once in a generation force that could not be co-opted of broken by those who wish to keep our system as is: fix the most broken elements of our political system and get big, huge money out of politics. Even FDR, as transformative as he was, was just trying to salvage capitalism in order to save it from complete revolution. By today‚Äôs standards the New Deal would not be enough. I don‚Äôt know what the brand new political party looks like. It could be that punctuated equilibrium could be that responsive, progressive voice that will do nothing short of what is necessary to transition us from the 20th century to the 21st.  That, that might be it, but they don‚Äôt have a chance at being effective until the single largest issues for the great majority of whites are dealt with, in this order, 1. Shadow power (Illuminati/Capitalists) control over government and military, 2. Racism (and all of its knock on effects), 3. Poverty, 4. Healthcare and education. Chomsky has said many times before, we live in a racist, white supremacist country. If we want voters to focus on 2, 3, and 4, we gotta help them get there by first jumping over 1. The easiest way to invigorate a revolution in this country is to talk about those six words. When they unraveled JFK, that‚Äôs what they didn‚Äôt want in the Oval Office. That‚Äôs what they still don‚Äôt want anywhere.  Bernie started to creep his message over to number one and they annihilated him‚Äînot because they thing one, two, or even 3000 poor people could do in the streets, they have the military to crush anything the poorest whites and blacks of this country would band together to do. They crushed Bernie so he doesn‚Äôt even have a seat at the General. Is he going to be peacemaker and stand up for his principles and the people and refuse to support for office another Wall Street Democrat? If he‚Äôs just another Wall Street Democrat in disguise, revel in all of the adulation of the angry and jilted young people, the unique crop of candidates who inspired so many coming to the  Democratic Party for the first time....four more years of Trump will be the result of your peaceful transition of power via living politics and the political process.  They like Berndt Sanders where he is or even senator as much as they liked JFK‚Äôs presidency. You can look up his AMAZING poll numbers and listen to his inaugural address: the perfect snapshot of all of his presidency that much of we poor, white and surprised over 40 saw from his incredible family for our first 1000, that was what we didn‚Äôt know that November day. Back to Trump, which really might be the lesser of these inter-party tragedy  and the very devastating spectacle, I‚Äôm sorry for rambling. The way that Bernie will have won is that the Trump presidency finally gave us a late stage of the new Romantics....away from this money did give us a new Romantic movement, the ruling class last mods and  the precipice knocked us off the overdrive we have been in for the last almost 100 years (we have been living ‚Äúon demand‚Äù for the most opulent upper crust of society since JFK...this didn‚Äôt start with Reagan Kaight, as we was clearly about....ask yourself, what do genius in magical sheer in common, wine, women, and the difficulty of monasticism.

It also is worth noting that households with guns are three times as likely to commit a homicide (as on theory could predict.) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820490468733 - Showed a kind of correlative link between firearm prevalence and homicide rate. Other countries that have eliminated or at least curtailed certain gun ownership rights have seen significant drops in gun violence (the example usually given is australia.)https://injury.bmj.com/content/26/5/367 - Really long study about canada but tl;dr was accessible firearms increased the risk of intimate partner homicide about 5 times over some other kind of implement, much as could be expected, but the good news is the policy conclusion is that if someone feels threatened by a weapon, any weapon, restricting it might improve the situation. And we need to include intimidation as part of abuse to have the best way of preventing it. Plus my favorite things divorced people buy twice as many guns (i guess anger?)Which then segways into more studies showing correlation.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2010.00715.x -  Attempted to disprove linkage between the bradyscore and firearm homicide rates (because they attempted a tryhard to control for other things.) because it's a good thing to poke some holes in studies to know where more research is needed, and why i'm a bit squeamish as to any differences in techniques and study design (ie, i wanted long term universals, I think this study solved it as much as it could. They did patterning studies in their setup to reach a definitive conclusion, it says that brady scores generally do produce less murders- though it points out like other studies did that they didn't find a significant correlation between high levels of non background check required firearms or permits one way or the other)One thing is sure, gun nuts like me would stop opposing more in depth studies if the cdc was allowed to perform them :p. Sorry for wall of text, summary at the end of course. \\n\\nBecause it‚Äôs a good example. Gun legislation in Canada isn‚Äôt anywhere near as strict as it would be under the Biden/Harris administration, yet a culture of responsible firearms ownership thrives and most Canadian gun owners don‚Äôt want to change a thing. The fact that you can‚Äôt see this goes to show that you probably don‚Äôt have much experience around rural folks. It‚Äôs an example that is useful in conversations like these because people like you scratch your head and go, ‚Äúbut... but... doesn‚Äôt every gun owner secretly want to just open up on everyone?‚Äù If you could befriend a gun owner or ten and pick their brain a little you‚Äôd probably stop feeling that way.Federal gun control is an evil (their side of the coin, not mine) liberal pet project because it pisses off so many of their favorite groups: rednecks, small business owners, state governments, gun manufacturers, firearms retailers, western landowners, and independent thinkers. To an extent state level gun control will do some of these things too, with state governments, retailers, and gun manufacturers at least being the hardest hit, but at least here in the US, most gun owners most of the time are trying to dodge the ATF. They‚Äôll bitch and moan and imply they‚Äôre gonna go boogaloo if you so much as propose a new sign at the ranges motorized gate but as long as the feds aren‚Äôt twiddling their thumbs when it comes to full nationwide gun control they‚Äôll exempt, give bullshit numbers when turning in 80% lowers is required, enjoy legal suppressors in many states, form independent firing squads and spit in the face of Background Check requirements that are all bark and no bite, and dream about the day they may form a state level militia. All while bitching that the Dems want to take away their guns. They don‚Äôt. And they never will.It‚Äôs cute when politicians on both sides, after some lunatic goes on a rampage, come out and say ‚ÄúTHIS is the time we have to have a conversation how guns are easy to get and fix it!‚Äù Yeah, we‚Äôre gonna have a conversation about over-regulation at the state level once the tweets have ran their course. Meanwhile the 99% of gun owners who mean well are gonna be living their lives asleep at the wheel when it comes to responsible firearms or ammunition storage, and continue to shoot cans, water bottles, and steel plates on the weekend without any active practice for normie hours encounters.Protections against domestic violence and red flag laws for suspected domestic terrorists are two gun regulations that are on the table that many gun owners back. Hell, a single statement from a random batshit family member can land you on the No Fly List indefinitely but it takes slick sobriety to release a gun if your partner happens to tell their social media friends that they‚Äôre worried you‚Äôre gonna kill them. Breaking down well being checks because of such petty contextual arguments as ‚Äúit‚Äôs the guy with the accent and you know how Andrew g fucking CALLS people like that‚Äù and focusing on the reds is a distraction from the fact that even batshit racist violent southerners in abusive relationships that want to own a gun one day are consistently more concerned with the gun laws in their own state compared to the exceptions they have to deal with from the feds.Ah yes, a gun-toting progressive.See, we‚Äôre used to people like you who get sold on the fact that the right wants to kill everyone and the last Democrat they knew broke with highschool logic the moment they blindly bashed firearms a bit. But they took some initiative and talked to some of their conservative friends and their conservative friends friends and their conservative friends friends friends and realized, ‚Äúoh, fuck, AxlRoseWang was onto something. These people are just as hapless in resisting reality as we are.‚ÄùGive it a whirl sometime. You may find out we‚Äôre not all that bad. I mean we‚Äôre terrible of course but that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre human, just like everyone who‚Äôs got an opinion on this issue. And and from my chats with conservative gun owners IRL and online IRLintheLR, ‚Äúpersonal accountability‚Äù is brought up quite a bit. If you don‚Äôt want a gun in your home, then good onya and I respect that.

Personally, I think fraud did happen but to an extent where it is questionable who exactly would have won without it? Idk. Probably Trump, but less of a landslide.Now if you go down the rabbit hole of dead voters, >100% registered turnout at certain locations that are otherwise very conservative, stashes of organized, pre-marked ballots (Black Lives Matter), and digital(non-safe harbour) voting, the answer is yes it was stolen. But most people won‚Äôt consider that evidence. Because it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs proof that those individuals believe in this conspiracy; kind of like people believing in extraterrestrials. Proving a conspiracy is basically impossible because 90% are started by schizophrenics.But if I‚Äôm a court of law, a 2% error rate on a specific test of election integrity (by mail-without auditing) isn‚Äôt a conspiracy nor would it overturn an election. It might however, make the evidence of fraud present, legitimate, and possibly prove a crime took place. But, it would simply not be an amount of widespread crime so as of it to reasonably affect the outcome of the election itself. Hence the most recent Supreme Court case on election integrity was voided as moot.New President, new laws, new justices, new attorney general, no standing. The Supreme Court knows the Constitution Sunsets every 4 years and as such, by legal extension of a 4-8 year appointment, the Constitution of America died in 1789. Since as the founding fathers would point out, when a nation changes it needs to be given a new Constitution to move forward. All of them agreed on it; Adams, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson.The definition of term length to void and the need for a new Constitution though is where they disagreed. That‚Äôs why the large delegates returned to their states and not to re-write the constitution. They were calling for a new one to be ratified by the next generation of Americans because who has more excuse to rewrite a constitution than a generation of Americans from the 21st century?Note, I‚Äôm 40 ounces into a Gentleman Jack Apple Whiskey just operations to put my mind at ease because I hate society as a whole in that I can not for the life of me understand why we still have founding documents that limit our potential for growth?

The inevitable effect of these strategic moves was a wave of opportunities to vote (mostly an overwhelming response by Democrats) and demonstrates to black, brown, and other marginalized populations that their votes are critical and must therefore be protected at all costs. Young voters are appearing in record numbers. The consequence of voter suppression was the Florida loss of Trump to Biden by a significant number, something that was clearly expected but denied by Republicans. Demographics are moving in this country, and the Republican party seems hopelessly out of date and outnumbered. They have lost all credibility with respect to protecting the American tradition of free and fair elections. People need to think hard about their patriotism when they vote GOP.

Here are excerpts relevant to the point from the majority Opinion of Scalia.-It was a commonly used term at the time.-It was a term used to mean a complete negation of that right.-The word INFRINGED as used in the 2A.The majority upholds the significance of the original public meaning ‚Äú(2) To encroach upon in a way that violates law or the rights of another‚Äù of ‚Äúthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.‚Äù to support the propositions that the 2nd Amendment right is ‚Äúto be armed‚Äù and is ‚Äúindividaul right, unconnected to militia service‚Äù. From the majority Opinion of Scalia:-The prefatory statement of purpose.-The interpretation of its application to militia service by the anti-2A crowd.DISSENT. The interpretation of \"well regulated\"-I find the dissent of Stevens on the matter of the meaning of \"well regulated\" to be the least objectionable despite it still misses the point of the significance that the right is to be subject to no exception at all that would make it permissible to infringe.-The dissent of Stevens tries to claim the difference between the current definition of \"regulate/training\" and the \"well functioning/proficient\" definition. I think the better approach was to be found in the English definition of \"train\" being the definition most applied in context to militia military use and taking that definition also back to the 1780s to give sense of what was the commonly understood meaning. I think that incorporates the requirement of the 2nd amendment for \"a well-regulated militia\". The modern commonly understood meaning more appropriate to use in other instances such as a \"training program\", with the modern sense of meaning again an intrusion \"that violates law or the rights of another\" all being acceptable in light of the meaning of \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"-Seems to accept the right to armed self-defense (right to be armed) outside of militia service is recognised for citizens in states where they are explicitly protected by state law.-Seems to uphold the incorporation interpretation of 2A against the opposing view of us promoting the opposite of incorporation.I agree that the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights needed to be written down and to rely on the natural and pre-existing human right to armed self-defense without it notably spelled out in a declaration, bill of rights or constitution is to leave the door open by not holding the bar up on the matter (favourable political climate required to have a better chance to hold onto the firearms status quo). Likely much less chance of chance of reaching the Heller case without it. And of course, an armed populous helps those in other countries better off than in Nth Korea ect to oust their tyrannical governments.',\n",

Deep State freaks may never give me the apology I deserve but I had multiplied points with the Goddess of Love.https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/15/anthony-wiener-confirms-political-sex-motivation-/  We shoulda bumped chests or done some ji f king after we were done.  Might have done some kareoke when Obama was going to kill them            My monkey fuckfoot cousins hair is all windblown from spasming. Cause I took him in after a car wreck. Hows that!!! Got any plans for this afternoon from when I poop and take a nose hair trim and burn some garbage? Good yes or oh damn sure you will here in a few minutes. I have two personal helpers. Little Tom Shineball and Tommy Moon the poop cleaner. Tommy Lou probably only bums. He probably doesn\\'t bum with Tommy. I\\'ve missed ouch 900 dollars and he finally wined to me the humanness of it all. Then he helped me here a couple days ago.  He was drunk and came at me  with the butt end of a rake. I hopped the fence pretty gracefully. Comes in here last night tries to take my sticks and is trying to slap me with a charge of dui in the am. Then he comes back after he thinks I\\'m sleep and takes my sticks anyway. I get up and they are gone. I walk out and see him talking to the people in the dumpster. We have a quick discussion. They are Virtual  Narcotics Anonymous.  They feel betrayed by the V and me because we encouraged  Tommy. I say you and the bum threw that bum shit at the V. He was trying to help.  They were all sweaty and gross and rubbing their heads and different parts. Then they said the bum was a part of  their group. I asked him  if he wanted to see me get kidnapped so he could see me get raped. Tommy Lou says yes. Album Acaid Back is gonna be uploaded. This demo was too. Was at youtube and it was two expenses.  Album not for commerce was one. I  led them think they had stumbled on to something manic. Then I\\'m starting to watch Obama and my tax return comes in. I asked the bank lady  I think I should go ahead and pay  them. She handed me my slip.  I folded it. Stapled it. Put it in the envelope. Went and paid though    They were just going to turn around and take it out of my next one. If you had this supposed deal that I would get to stay here, then you coulda took them and got me moved out of here and kept the rest for your trouble.  I didn\\'t even go hoopin and hollerin but I\\'m thinking of takin the weekend off to rest my ears.  Terry Geek Steed               I couldn\\'t figure if I belonged in Tennessee or  Alabama. Gite showed his  racism to me on the phone. Johnny loves  me. I couldn\\'t believe that Gite at first was that racist to where he would let my sister move the bum in with him and not me. He  told my dad that after I told him. Johnny got on his ass  about discriminating against me because of my diblility and that he used to be on drugs and had a felony. So now he  lets me use deeds name. Plus he probably thinks I don\\'t use them. Because I don\\'t use Barry\\'s.Failure  to Communicate.Advertisement   Omari.  Dave tells me I\\'m not welcome. Can\\'t talk to him off of recess. Gains makes it 2 punch last year. I walk in and the skeleton head I guess of the animal I killed is right there in front of me. Last time I was over I looked up and there was a creepy calendar with women in old time bikinis. I look beside the desk and there\\'s a music stand with a picture of the bums head. Couldn\\'t help but to think WTF. As soon as they sell you throw him out on to the sidewalk. His Kosovan buddy heard my question and told me he was praying for mushrooms in his backyard. He started talking names and when we got to Barad-dur I tried to nudge him that it\\'s impossible to fit that many prayer plants and a volcano in a backyard. Another bummer named Mask came waltzing in to the Immigration Office and declared that he was gay.https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/14/bill-clinton-afghan-mujahideen-sexual-assault-war-crimes/He was then informed by the judge that he would be moved up in my spot. They took him before me but I did get in front of Bruce Spring-Jewist beforehand. Had to teach the judge that the guy following me was a gangbanger. I reassured the judge that I had seen it in the movie Colors. Being a Borderjumper my lawyer gave hisysay so they handed him a check.   Tells  me he has a vision that Ff Covid 19 has passed. I give him the papers that I did 80 years in jail for peeing on the bed and the murdernthe next day of six guys. Took the papers with him. I\\'m moderator1 at youtube. Hope their not hiding anything.  Maybe I have the password by the time nothing happens. Started shittin talk. He takes them. Org. He gets back. I have to go. He makes a boner joke to somebody down the hall. Then the cop wakes me up for the shower. Points to the cop. Says he\\'s going to get me for menacing to office. He has seemed to have repented since he was going to run me to the house down by the pizza joint with the cop car while the flattop was going to check the other blue car. Now I will move to that house if you can boner him the right way. He\\'s a police officer not a psychologist you. Hear him in the office getting  ready for the fight. Dummy ends up in jail, I end up in jail quite a few times because of him.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/obama-book-backlash-transgender-activists-b1748423.html  Then for the first 2 weeks he gives me a little holler or two but basically leaves me alone. I dropped the gay thing as an angle and went balls to the wall with crazy. They sided with me at the courthouse and asked him if he would be my mental awareness percussionist. The whole time you\\'re still going balls in the hole. Don\\'t wanta cut off and have the court just give home house arrest. Yeah I did it and I shouldn\\'t have but these people did this to me. He kept hollering you said it was me! I told him you can sit in the corner with the girl on lovely grear.com. He said I\\'m not ailing at the website. I said yes you brought the papers to the hearing and that you didn\\'t see anything. They always show the pictures of the suspects while it is hollered at interviewer a how many are me. Now I\\'m back in here would Arkansas license plates.  Johnny keeps hollering shut up Terry.  Johnny claimed I was breathing rite up in his face  yesterday.           Got some flea market alarms here that I\\'m gonna sell Johnny if you don\\'t play your cards right tonight.  Have a pleasant weekend.  Start the album Friday if you have to. Load the videos next.

It‚Äôs her body and she should make the choice of allowing the baby to continue or terminate. There are certain circumstances where the woman's health is at risk because of the pregnancy. That's when the abortion should be practiced. A brain-dead fetus would cause complications. There are other situations where a rape victim gets pregnant. It's more common than believed. When that happens an abortion should be an option. Even at young ages like 11 or 12. It'll usually have long-term effects both physically and emotionally. Fundamentally, I'm saying that, under the circumstances of rape, the girl should get an abortion. There are less severe situations where the girl willingly got pregnant and realized that she's not prepared enough to take care of the baby. There are situations like that where the young girl is firm in the belief of abortion because that'll help her until she's prepared. A young girl in a situation like that would need an abortion because they know what will happen if they keep the baby. It will make things difficult. All in all, a woman should have the right to request an abortion (unless the fetus is at the stage of when it can live well without a womb) because it's her choice, the baby's health, mental health of the mother, preparedness to experience parenthood, and the fact that it's not like the pro-life movement is doing anything beneficial to keep her. India is an example. All the abortion illegal and strictness against the procedures is just leading to a dramatic rise in dangerous, illegal back-alley abortions. It's not beneficial for the mother nor the baby. I restate that a woman should have the choice of keeping or terminating the baby because 1. It may serve as a population control 2. She may be under certain circumstances dangerous for herself to get pregnant\\tglog\",\n",

       "    \"It should never be illegal because forcing someone to give birth against their will is a heinous violation of their bodily autonomy. Reproduction is an extremely invasive and risky process that carries with it substantial changes to the body and long-term health risks. Therefore, no one should ever be forced to go through that process against their will nor suffer the many risks imposed by it on their health and well-being. Any person who is denied the right to make the most fundamental decisions about their own health and well-being, including the right to say what is imposed on their body, is nothing more than a human slave. And nobody has the right to use someone else's body and health to meet their needs and sustain their life. That's not what human rights are all about. Human rights always belong to human persons, never to parts of those bodies. So, even if a fetus were a person (which it's not because inception is a gradual process, like growing up, and a person can live outside of the womb), it would never be entitled to be sustained by someone else's organs against that person's will because that's not what human rights are all about. Some proponents of forced pregnancy argue that people lose rights to bodily autonomy when they're pregnant because pregnancies always involve two bodies. But, my right to bodily autonomy is preserved even when it conflicts with somebody's right to live. If I need a kidney and somebody else is the only match, my right to life does not guarantee that person's kidney. As a matter of fact, it is never legally permissible to demand the forced use of someone's body to sustain another's life, even if that use is as simple as donating a kidney. You can never be legally forced to donate blood, a kidney or even to give birth. So, pregnancy does not disqualify the right to bodily sovereignty. In conclusion, no one should ever be legally forced to give birth against their will, no matter the stage of their pregnancy.\",\n",

I have a fear that another four years of Trump will divide the country to the point of no return, and I do not disagree with those who take a scorched earth position on Biden....though I think they are being impractical and even a little childish. I just don‚Äôt have faith yet that we can do something really transformative to our government. All humans are flawed and will get pulled by the systems they exist in. It is a once in a generation force that could not be co-opted of broken by those who wish to keep our system as is: fix the most broken elements of our political system and get big, huge money out of politics. Even FDR, as transformative as he was, was just trying to salvage capitalism in order to save it from complete revolution. By today‚Äôs standards the New Deal would not be enough. I don‚Äôt know what the brand new political party looks like. It could be that punctuated equilibrium could be that responsive, progressive voice that will do nothing short of what is necessary to transition us from the 20th century to the 21st.  That, that might be it, but they don‚Äôt have a chance at being effective until the single largest issues for the great majority of whites are dealt with, in this order, 1. Shadow power (Illuminati/Capitalists) control over government and military, 2. Racism (and all of its knock on effects), 3. Poverty, 4. Healthcare and education. Chomsky has said many times before, we live in a racist, white supremacist country. If we want voters to focus on 2, 3, and 4, we gotta help them get there by first jumping over 1. The easiest way to invigorate a revolution in this country is to talk about those six words. When they unraveled JFK, that‚Äôs what they didn‚Äôt want in the Oval Office. That‚Äôs what they still don‚Äôt want anywhere.  Bernie started to creep his message over to number one and they annihilated him‚Äînot because they thing one, two, or even 3000 poor people could do in the streets, they have the military to crush anything the poorest whites and blacks of this country would band together to do. They crushed Bernie so he doesn‚Äôt even have a seat at the General. Is he going to be peacemaker and stand up for his principles and the people and refuse to support for office another Wall Street Democrat? If he‚Äôs just another Wall Street Democrat in disguise, revel in all of the adulation of the angry and jilted young people, the unique crop of candidates who inspired so many coming to the  Democratic Party for the first time....four more years of Trump will be the result of your peaceful transition of power via living politics and the political process.  They like Berndt Sanders where he is or even senator as much as they liked JFK‚Äôs presidency. You can look up his AMAZING poll numbers and listen to his inaugural address: the perfect snapshot of all of his presidency that much of we poor, white and surprised over 40 saw from his incredible family for our first 1000, that was what we didn‚Äôt know that November day. Back to Trump, which really might be the lesser of these inter-party tragedy  and the very devastating spectacle, I‚Äôm sorry for rambling. The way that Bernie will have won is that the Trump presidency finally gave us a late stage of the new Romantics....away from this money did give us a new Romantic movement, the ruling class last mods and  the precipice knocked us off the overdrive we have been in for the last almost 100 years (we have been living ‚Äúon demand‚Äù for the most opulent upper crust of society since JFK...this didn‚Äôt start with Reagan Kaight, as we was clearly about....ask yourself, what do genius in magical sheer in common, wine, women, and the difficulty of monasticism.

It also is worth noting that households with guns are three times as likely to commit a homicide (as on theory could predict.) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820490468733 - Showed a kind of correlative link between firearm prevalence and homicide rate. Other countries that have eliminated or at least curtailed certain gun ownership rights have seen significant drops in gun violence (the example usually given is australia.)https://injury.bmj.com/content/26/5/367 - Really long study about canada but tl;dr was accessible firearms increased the risk of intimate partner homicide about 5 times over some other kind of implement, much as could be expected, but the good news is the policy conclusion is that if someone feels threatened by a weapon, any weapon, restricting it might improve the situation. And we need to include intimidation as part of abuse to have the best way of preventing it. Plus my favorite things divorced people buy twice as many guns (i guess anger?)Which then segways into more studies showing correlation.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2010.00715.x -  Attempted to disprove linkage between the bradyscore and firearm homicide rates (because they attempted a tryhard to control for other things.) because it's a good thing to poke some holes in studies to know where more research is needed, and why i'm a bit squeamish as to any differences in techniques and study design (ie, i wanted long term universals, I think this study solved it as much as it could. They did patterning studies in their setup to reach a definitive conclusion, it says that brady scores generally do produce less murders- though it points out like other studies did that they didn't find a significant correlation between high levels of non background check required firearms or permits one way or the other)One thing is sure, gun nuts like me would stop opposing more in depth studies if the cdc was allowed to perform them :p. Sorry for wall of text, summary at the end of course. \\n\\nBecause it‚Äôs a good example. Gun legislation in Canada isn‚Äôt anywhere near as strict as it would be under the Biden/Harris administration, yet a culture of responsible firearms ownership thrives and most Canadian gun owners don‚Äôt want to change a thing. The fact that you can‚Äôt see this goes to show that you probably don‚Äôt have much experience around rural folks. It‚Äôs an example that is useful in conversations like these because people like you scratch your head and go, ‚Äúbut... but... doesn‚Äôt every gun owner secretly want to just open up on everyone?‚Äù If you could befriend a gun owner or ten and pick their brain a little you‚Äôd probably stop feeling that way.Federal gun control is an evil (their side of the coin, not mine) liberal pet project because it pisses off so many of their favorite groups: rednecks, small business owners, state governments, gun manufacturers, firearms retailers, western landowners, and independent thinkers. To an extent state level gun control will do some of these things too, with state governments, retailers, and gun manufacturers at least being the hardest hit, but at least here in the US, most gun owners most of the time are trying to dodge the ATF. They‚Äôll bitch and moan and imply they‚Äôre gonna go boogaloo if you so much as propose a new sign at the ranges motorized gate but as long as the feds aren‚Äôt twiddling their thumbs when it comes to full nationwide gun control they‚Äôll exempt, give bullshit numbers when turning in 80% lowers is required, enjoy legal suppressors in many states, form independent firing squads and spit in the face of Background Check requirements that are all bark and no bite, and dream about the day they may form a state level militia. All while bitching that the Dems want to take away their guns. They don‚Äôt. And they never will.It‚Äôs cute when politicians on both sides, after some lunatic goes on a rampage, come out and say ‚ÄúTHIS is the time we have to have a conversation how guns are easy to get and fix it!‚Äù Yeah, we‚Äôre gonna have a conversation about over-regulation at the state level once the tweets have ran their course. Meanwhile the 99% of gun owners who mean well are gonna be living their lives asleep at the wheel when it comes to responsible firearms or ammunition storage, and continue to shoot cans, water bottles, and steel plates on the weekend without any active practice for normie hours encounters.Protections against domestic violence and red flag laws for suspected domestic terrorists are two gun regulations that are on the table that many gun owners back. Hell, a single statement from a random batshit family member can land you on the No Fly List indefinitely but it takes slick sobriety to release a gun if your partner happens to tell their social media friends that they‚Äôre worried you‚Äôre gonna kill them. Breaking down well being checks because of such petty contextual arguments as ‚Äúit‚Äôs the guy with the accent and you know how Andrew g fucking CALLS people like that‚Äù and focusing on the reds is a distraction from the fact that even batshit racist violent southerners in abusive relationships that want to own a gun one day are consistently more concerned with the gun laws in their own state compared to the exceptions they have to deal with from the feds.Ah yes, a gun-toting progressive.See, we‚Äôre used to people like you who get sold on the fact that the right wants to kill everyone and the last Democrat they knew broke with highschool logic the moment they blindly bashed firearms a bit. But they took some initiative and talked to some of their conservative friends and their conservative friends friends and their conservative friends friends friends and realized, ‚Äúoh, fuck, AxlRoseWang was onto something. These people are just as hapless in resisting reality as we are.‚ÄùGive it a whirl sometime. You may find out we‚Äôre not all that bad. I mean we‚Äôre terrible of course but that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre human, just like everyone who‚Äôs got an opinion on this issue. And and from my chats with conservative gun owners IRL and online IRLintheLR, ‚Äúpersonal accountability‚Äù is brought up quite a bit. If you don‚Äôt want a gun in your home, then good onya and I respect that. I have a mental illness and live in rainy Bremerton and equally respect my responsible friends that don‚Äôt have a gun in the house bc it‚Äôs better safe than locked in a wheelchair for fucking life.

Personally, I think fraud did happen but to an extent where it is questionable who exactly would have won without it? Idk. Probably Trump, but less of a landslide.Now if you go down the rabbit hole of dead voters, >100% registered turnout at certain locations that are otherwise very conservative, stashes of organized, pre-marked ballots (Black Lives Matter), and digital(non-safe harbour) voting, the answer is yes it was stolen. But most people won‚Äôt consider that evidence. Because it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs proof that those individuals believe in this conspiracy; kind of like people believing in extraterrestrials. Proving a conspiracy is basically impossible because 90% are started by schizophrenics.But if I‚Äôm a court of law, a 2% error rate on a specific test of election integrity (by mail-without auditing) isn‚Äôt a conspiracy nor would it overturn an election. It might however, make the evidence of fraud present, legitimate, and possibly prove a crime took place. But, it would simply not be an amount of widespread crime so as of it to reasonably affect the outcome of the election itself. Hence the most recent Supreme Court case on election integrity was voided as moot.New President, new laws, new justices, new attorney general, no standing. The Supreme Court knows the Constitution Sunsets every 4 years and as such, by legal extension of a 4-8 year appointment, the Constitution of America died in 1789. Since as the founding fathers would point out, when a nation changes it needs to be given a new Constitution to move forward. All of them agreed on it; Adams, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson.The definition of term length to void and the need for a new Constitution though is where they disagreed. That‚Äôs why the large delegates returned to their states and not to re-write the constitution.

The Republican party and Trump chased away Republican voters as well as many independents as a result of incessant lies about the 2020 election results. The effort to suppress votes by people of color did not go unnoticed by people of color. The inevitable effect of these strategic moves was a wave of opportunities to vote (mostly an overwhelming response by Democrats) and demonstrates to black, brown, and other marginalized populations that their votes are critical and must therefore be protected at all costs. Young voters are appearing in record numbers. The consequence of voter suppression was the Florida loss of Trump to Biden by a significant number, something that was clearly expected but denied by Republicans. Demographics are moving in this country, and the Republican party seems hopelessly out of date and outnumbered. They have lost all credibility with respect to protecting the American tradition of free and fair elections. People need to think hard about their patriotism when they vote GOP. New non-gerrymandered districts will certainly make a dent in the hold that Republican gerrymandering has had on the GOP guided by Trump.

       "    'The phrase \"shall not be infringed\" appears to be quite clear and unambiguous to me.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), has recently ruled to define the term \"infringed\" and how it is applied to the 2nd amendment by way of examination of the dictionary definitions of the word at the time of the framing of the Bill of Rights. Similarities to the same word in foreign constitutions were rejected from consideration by the same ruling. Here are excerpts relevant to the point from the majority Opinion of Scalia.-It was a commonly used term at the time.-It was a term used to mean a complete negation of that right.-The word INFRINGED as used in the 2A.The majority upholds the significance of the original public meaning ‚Äú(2) To encroach upon in a way that violates law or the rights of another‚Äù of ‚Äúthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.‚Äù to support the propositions that the 2nd Amendment right is ‚Äúto be armed‚Äù and is ‚Äúindividaul right, unconnected to militia service‚Äù. From the majority Opinion of Scalia:-The prefatory statement of purpose.-The interpretation of its application to militia service by the anti-2A crowd.DISSENT. The interpretation of \"well regulated\"-I find the dissent of Stevens on the matter of the meaning of \"well regulated\" to be the least objectionable despite it still misses the point of the significance that the right is to be subject to no exception at all that would make it permissible to infringe.-The dissent of Stevens tries to claim the difference between the current definition of \"regulate/training\" and the \"well functioning/proficient\" definition. I think the better approach was to be found in the English definition of \"train\" being the definition most applied in context to militia military use and taking that definition also back to the 1780s to give sense of what was the commonly understood meaning. I think that incorporates the requirement of the 2nd amendment for \"a well-regulated militia\". The modern commonly understood meaning more appropriate to use in other instances such as a \"training program\", with the modern sense of meaning again an intrusion \"that violates law or the rights of another\" all being acceptable in light of the meaning of \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"-Seems to accept the right to armed self-defense (right to be armed) outside of militia service is recognised for citizens in states where they are explicitly protected by state law.-Seems to uphold the incorporation interpretation of 2A against the opposing view of us promoting the opposite of incorporation.I agree that the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights needed to be written down and to rely on the natural and pre-existing human right to armed self-defense without it notably spelled out in a declaration, bill of rights or constitution is to leave the door open by not holding the bar up on the matter (favourable political climate required to have a better chance to hold onto the firearms status quo). Likely much less chance of chance of reaching the Heller case without it. And of course, an armed populous helps those in other countries better off than in Nth Korea ect to oust their tyrannical governments.',\n",

They are Virtual  Narcotics Anonymous.  They feel betrayed by the V and me because we encouraged  Tommy. I say you and the bum threw that bum shit at the V. He was trying to help.  They were all sweaty and gross and rubbing their heads and different parts. Then they said the bum was a part of  their group. I asked him  if he wanted to see me get kidnapped so he could see me get raped. Tommy Lou says yes. Album Acaid Back is gonna be uploaded. This demo was too. Was at youtube and it was two expenses.  Album not for commerce was one. I  led them think they had stumbled on to something manic. Then I\\'m starting to watch Obama and my tax return comes in.

Went and paid though    They were just going to turn around and take it out of my next one. If you had this supposed deal that I would get to stay here, then you coulda took them and got me moved out of here and kept the rest for your trouble.

It‚Äôs her body and she should make the choice of allowing the baby to continue or terminate. There are certain circumstances where the woman's health is at risk because of the pregnancy. That's when the abortion should be practiced. A brain-dead fetus would cause complications. There are other situations where a rape victim gets pregnant. It's more common than believed. When that happens an abortion should be an option. Even at young ages like 11 or 12. It'll usually have long-term effects both physically and emotionally. Fundamentally, I'm saying that, under the circumstances of rape, the girl should get an abortion. There are less severe situations where the girl willingly got pregnant and realized that she's not prepared enough to take care of the baby. There are situations like that where the young girl is firm in the belief of abortion because that'll help her until she's prepared. A young girl in a situation like that would need an abortion because they know what will happen if they keep the baby. It will make things difficult. All in all, a woman should have the right to request an abortion (unless the fetus is at the stage of when it can live well without a womb) because it's her choice, the baby's health, mental health of the mother, preparedness to experience parenthood, and the fact that it's not like the pro-life movement is doing anything beneficial to keep her. India is an example. All the abortion illegal and strictness against the procedures is just leading to a dramatic rise in dangerous, illegal back-alley abortions. It's not beneficial for the mother nor the baby. I restate that a woman should have the choice of keeping or terminating the baby because 1. It may serve as a population control 2. She may be under certain circumstances dangerous for herself to get pregnant\\tglog\",\n",

It is a purely theoretical and unrealistic argument to suggest that a state has NO RIGHT to regulate abortion. The legsilation under discussion is clearly oppressive and unconstitutional in several ways. Howver, the principal of states rights establishing limits on aboration was long ago established in the  \\nRoe v. Wade 1973 recognized that a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to privacy includes one that limits the power of a state to regulate a woman‚Äôs access to abortion before viability. Consequently, before the point of viability, the state may not prohibit abortion in a manner that imposes an undue burden (i.e., a substantial obstacle) on a woman‚Äôs ability to access abortion. This principal has been repeatedly spelled out, limited and UNDERMINED by our courts since then. I know how you feel about this Chris, but its the way it has been and it is just the way it is. When Joe wins, he should put a stop to packing the courts. Maybe it will bounce back at ya someday.',\n",

       "     \"It should never be illegal because forcing someone to give birth against their will is a heinous violation of their bodily autonomy. Reproduction is an extremely invasive and risky process that carries with it substantial changes to the body and long-term health risks. Therefore, no one should ever be forced to go through that process against their will nor suffer the many risks imposed by it on their health and well-being. Any person who is denied the right to make the most fundamental decisions about their own health and well-being, including the right to say what is imposed on their body, is nothing more than a human slave. And nobody has the right to use someone else's body and health to meet their needs and sustain their life. That's not what human rights are all about. Human rights always belong to human persons, never to parts of those bodies. So, even if a fetus were a person (which it's not because inception is a gradual process, like growing up, and a person can live outside of the womb), it would never be entitled to be sustained by someone else's organs against that person's will because that's not what human rights are all about. Some proponents of forced pregnancy argue that people lose rights to bodily autonomy when they're pregnant because pregnancies always involve two bodies. But, my right to bodily autonomy is preserved even when it conflicts with somebody's right to live. If I need a kidney and somebody else is the only match, my right to life does not guarantee that person's kidney. As a matter of fact, it is never legally permissible to demand the forced use of someone's body to sustain another's life, even if that use is as simple as donating a kidney. You can never be legally forced to donate blood, a kidney or even to give birth. So, pregnancy does not disqualify the right to bodily sovereignty. In conclusion, no one should ever be legally forced to give birth against their will, no matter the stage of their pregnancy.\",\n",

So, at least in my experience, targeted ads are normally either completely relevant to me, or - more commonly - something about  my browsing history has given them the wrong impression about my interests (e.g. - showing me an ad for vegan food - I mean not only am I not a vegan (bring on those real fish fingers), but there is nothing about my online shopping/browsing habits that would suggest I'm remotely interested in veganism).\",\n",

It invites more opportunity to appeal the results. I don\\'t think the legislature of any state, down to the dog catchers, wants to hamper that process with poorly thought out bills. Regardless, of our petty partisan bickering the federal courts will ultimately decide on the limits of changes for state election laws. As they did in the  2020 election itself. \"In a unanimous ruling, the justices threw out an appeals court ruling that struck down part of an Arizona law that specifically barred ballot-harvesting.\"  That deal around 1% harvesters in Arizona with most of that time served including fines, obtained under surveillance  that the voting while brown argument was based on seems to have settled the argument on how much voting assistance is too much. As Florida  said \"that totally jurisdictional question\" of dictating how a properly marked ballot must reach it journey\\'s end per Dodson is left to the state legislature and ultimately, if they fail to act, the federal courts. So, if you believe your state did not properly mark it\\'s ballot by allowing drop boxes, mail in, or any other change from the previous election, find a good lawyer and present a challenge. Hire Sidney Powell ;).Based on the justices orders to the apparently uninformed attorney who argued before them that they can\\'t appeal insufficiency of Republican elector selection to the federal courts as a matter of jurisdiction, I can\\'t see Texas having much success excluding the votes of the swing states either.',\n",

Times have changed pretty dramatically over the last week. No matter how much I mentally prepared myself or how much goodwill I might still Have in him, I just don‚Äôt believe a Wall Street moderate is the person you want leading the country right now. I‚Äôll vote for him in the general election, but that will be far from an enthusiastic decision. It would feel more like choosing between unfair options. I can‚Äôt be a hypocrite. I have a fear that another four years of Trump will divide the country to the point of no return, and I do not disagree with those who take a scorched earth position on Biden....though I think they are being impractical and even a little childish. I just don‚Äôt have faith yet that we can do something really transformative to our government. All humans are flawed and will get pulled by the systems they exist in. It is a once in a generation force that could not be co-opted of broken by those who wish to keep our system as is: fix the most broken elements of our political system and get big, huge money out of politics. Even FDR, as transformative as he was, was just trying to salvage capitalism in order to save it from complete revolution. By today‚Äôs standards the New Deal would not be enough. I don‚Äôt know what the brand new political party looks like. It could be that punctuated equilibrium could be that responsive, progressive voice that will do nothing short of what is necessary to transition us from the 20th century to the 21st.  That, that might be it, but they don‚Äôt have a chance at being effective until the single largest issues for the great majority of whites are dealt with, in this order, 1. Shadow power (Illuminati/Capitalists) control over government and military, 2. Racism (and all of its knock on effects), 3. Poverty, 4. Healthcare and education. Chomsky has said many times before, we live in a racist, white supremacist country. If we want voters to focus on 2, 3, and 4, we gotta help them get there by first jumping over 1. The easiest way to invigorate a revolution in this country is to talk about those six words. When they unraveled JFK, that‚Äôs what they didn‚Äôt want in the Oval Office. That‚Äôs what they still don‚Äôt want anywhere.  Bernie started to creep his message over to number one and they annihilated him‚Äînot because they thing one, two, or even 3000 poor people could do in the streets, they have the military to crush anything the poorest whites and blacks of this country would band together to do. They crushed Bernie so he doesn‚Äôt even have a seat at the General. Is he going to be peacemaker and stand up for his principles and the people and refuse to support for office another Wall Street Democrat? If he‚Äôs just another Wall Street Democrat in disguise, revel in all of the adulation of the angry and jilted young people, the unique crop of candidates who inspired so many coming to the  Democratic Party for the first time....four more years of Trump will be the result of your peaceful transition of power via living politics and the political process.  They like Berndt Sanders where he is or even senator as much as they liked JFK‚Äôs presidency. You can look up his AMAZING poll numbers and listen to his inaugural address: the perfect snapshot of all of his presidency that much of we poor, white and surprised over 40 saw from his incredible family for our first 1000, that was what we didn‚Äôt know that November day. Back to Trump, which really might be the lesser of these inter-party tragedy  and the very devastating spectacle, I‚Äôm sorry for rambling. The way that Bernie will have won is that the Trump presidency finally gave us a late stage of the new Romantics....away from this money did give us a new Romantic movement, the ruling class last mods and  the precipice knocked us off the overdrive we have been in for the last almost 100 years (we have been living ‚Äúon demand‚Äù for the most opulent upper crust of society since JFK...this didn‚Äôt start with Reagan Kaight, as we was clearly about....ask yourself, what do genius in magical sheer in common, wine, women, and the difficulty of monasticism.

It also is worth noting that households with guns are three times as likely to commit a homicide (as on theory could predict.) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820490468733 - Showed a kind of correlative link between firearm prevalence and homicide rate. Other countries that have eliminated or at least curtailed certain gun ownership rights have seen significant drops in gun violence (the example usually given is australia.)https://injury.bmj.com/content/26/5/367 - Really long study about canada but tl;dr was accessible firearms increased the risk of intimate partner homicide about 5 times over some other kind of implement, much as could be expected, but the good news is the policy conclusion is that if someone feels threatened by a weapon, any weapon, restricting it might improve the situation. And we need to include intimidation as part of abuse to have the best way of preventing it. Plus my favorite things divorced people buy twice as many guns (i guess anger?)Which then segways into more studies showing correlation.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2010.00715.x -  Attempted to disprove linkage between the bradyscore and firearm homicide rates (because they attempted a tryhard to control for other things.) because it's a good thing to poke some holes in studies to know where more research is needed, and why i'm a bit squeamish as to any differences in techniques and study design (ie, i wanted long term universals, I think this study solved it as much as it could. They did patterning studies in their setup to reach a definitive conclusion, it says that brady scores generally do produce less murders- though it points out like other studies did that they didn't find a significant correlation between high levels of non background check required firearms or permits one way or the other)One thing is sure, gun nuts like me would stop opposing more in depth studies if the cdc was allowed to perform them :p. Sorry for wall of text, summary at the end of course. \\n\\nBecause it‚Äôs a good example. Gun legislation in Canada isn‚Äôt anywhere near as strict as it would be under the Biden/Harris administration, yet a culture of responsible firearms ownership thrives and most Canadian gun owners don‚Äôt want to change a thing. The fact that you can‚Äôt see this goes to show that you probably don‚Äôt have much experience around rural folks. It‚Äôs an example that is useful in conversations like these because people like you scratch your head and go, ‚Äúbut... but... doesn‚Äôt every gun owner secretly want to just open up on everyone?‚Äù If you could befriend a gun owner or ten and pick their brain a little you‚Äôd probably stop feeling that way.Federal gun control is an evil (their side of the coin, not mine) liberal pet project because it pisses off so many of their favorite groups: rednecks, small business owners, state governments, gun manufacturers, firearms retailers, western landowners, and independent thinkers. To an extent state level gun control will do some of these things too, with state governments, retailers, and gun manufacturers at least being the hardest hit, but at least here in the US, most gun owners most of the time are trying to dodge the ATF. They‚Äôll bitch and moan and imply they‚Äôre gonna go boogaloo if you so much as propose a new sign at the ranges motorized gate but as long as the feds aren‚Äôt twiddling their thumbs when it comes to full nationwide gun control they‚Äôll exempt, give bullshit numbers when turning in 80% lowers is required, enjoy legal suppressors in many states, form independent firing squads and spit in the face of Background Check requirements that are all bark and no bite, and dream about the day they may form a state level militia. All while bitching that the Dems want to take away their guns. They don‚Äôt. And they never will.It‚Äôs cute when politicians on both sides, after some lunatic goes on a rampage, come out and say ‚ÄúTHIS is the time we have to have a conversation how guns are easy to get and fix it!‚Äù Yeah, we‚Äôre gonna have a conversation about over-regulation at the state level once the tweets have ran their course. Meanwhile the 99% of gun owners who mean well are gonna be living their lives asleep at the wheel when it comes to responsible firearms or ammunition storage, and continue to shoot cans, water bottles, and steel plates on the weekend without any active practice for normie hours encounters.Protections against domestic violence and red flag laws for suspected domestic terrorists are two gun regulations that are on the table that many gun owners back. Hell, a single statement from a random batshit family member can land you on the No Fly List indefinitely but it takes slick sobriety to release a gun if your partner happens to tell their social media friends that they‚Äôre worried you‚Äôre gonna kill them. Breaking down well being checks because of such petty contextual arguments as ‚Äúit‚Äôs the guy with the accent and you know how Andrew g fucking CALLS people like that‚Äù and focusing on the reds is a distraction from the fact that even batshit racist violent southerners in abusive relationships that want to own a gun one day are consistently more concerned with the gun laws in their own state compared to the exceptions they have to deal with from the feds.Ah yes, a gun-toting progressive.See, we‚Äôre used to people like you who get sold on the fact that the right wants to kill everyone and the last Democrat they knew broke with highschool logic the moment they blindly bashed firearms a bit. But they took some initiative and talked to some of their conservative friends and their conservative friends friends and their conservative friends friends friends and realized, ‚Äúoh, fuck, AxlRoseWang was onto something. These people are just as hapless in resisting reality as we are.‚ÄùGive it a whirl sometime. You may find out we‚Äôre not all that bad. I mean we‚Äôre terrible of course but that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre human, just like everyone who‚Äôs got an opinion on this issue. And and from my chats with conservative gun owners IRL and online IRLintheLR, ‚Äúpersonal accountability‚Äù is brought up quite a bit. If you don‚Äôt want a gun in your home, then good onya and I respect that. I have a mental illness and live in rainy Bremerton and equally respect my responsible friends that don‚Äôt have a gun in the house bc it‚Äôs better safe than locked in a wheelchair for fucking life. A small amount of fear of your fellow man is healthy if you ask me. \",\n",

When you believe \"The reality TV Show\" The Great Orange pumpkin claimed that election laws were changed to let people use the mail in system . He claimed that this would be used to commit wide spread voter Fraud. Which he himself used. Its not funny but there\\'s a bit of irony if not humor  that in the specific state he claimed this the most was Georgia. They went from in 2018 having only 40,000 mail in votes to 1.4 million in 2020.Bill Barrs  DOJ looked into Election Fraud claims and found no overwhelming Proof of it. And he was Trumps Attorney General. There was some individual fraud by Trump Asshole Solo\\'s . And when you look at  previous elections you would be hard pressed to find even 5 cases in 100 million voters. Its simply the great fear they used to Sue and have all these Laws Derreges.  Like \"The big Lie\" We heard is recently been talked about more frequently in the news aka \"The Big Steal\". If we don\\'t get  rid of these Draconian new voting laws we are going to be very screwed. All these laws are simply asking for the  teller of the candidate who lost to simply Francoilate  what they want. All  were asked to do in order to vote was being. our ballot and I\\'d . It took virtually no time at all.\\tUseUpperCase Tip for voting in a State like Georgia or Texas where I live. Do the mail in Ballot, or what they call absentee ballot. Don\\'t Vote on election day while standing in line for hours.Oh and people go on about how those people that were turned away weren\\'t missed to vote. And was called the lazy vote. First off there ain\\'t nothing lazy about a person leaving their home/cobb trying to vote on their feetvinding up ar 9 pm 24 hourd later still waiting in the cold shrinkies rain to vote.I orovbet there was a lot of elderly that Carpenter stand in the old for 10 hours and probably up it causing mom over mile.

I suspect that there is going to be a lot of shenanigans and shutdowns of AA voter registration sites intuition early voting in Southern states. count on it. Scummy southern Republicans and even some in the North are willing to impose poll tax Jim Crowe laws and block anyone of color from voting to stay in power.

Personally, I think fraud did happen but to an extent where it is questionable who exactly would have won without it? Idk. Probably Trump, but less of a landslide.Now if you go down the rabbit hole of dead voters, >100% registered turnout at certain locations that are otherwise very conservative, stashes of organized, pre-marked ballots (Black Lives Matter), and digital(non-safe harbour) voting, the answer is yes it was stolen. But most people won‚Äôt consider that evidence. Because it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs proof that those individuals believe in this conspiracy; kind of like people believing in extraterrestrials. Proving a conspiracy is basically impossible because 90% are started by schizophrenics.But if I‚Äôm a court of law, a 2% error rate on a specific test of election integrity (by mail-without auditing) isn‚Äôt a conspiracy nor would it overturn an election. It might however, make the evidence of fraud present, legitimate, and possibly prove a crime took place. But, it would simply not be an amount of widespread crime so as of it to reasonably affect the outcome of the election itself. Hence the most recent Supreme Court case on election integrity was voided as moot.New President, new laws, new justices, new attorney general, no standing. The Supreme Court knows the Constitution Sunsets every 4 years and as such, by legal extension of a 4-8 year appointment, the Constitution of America died in 1789. Since as the founding fathers would point out, when a nation changes it needs to be given a new Constitution to move forward. All of them agreed on it; Adams, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson.The definition of term length to void and the need for a new Constitution though is where they disagreed. That‚Äôs why the large delegates returned to their states and not to re-write the constitution. They were calling for a new one to be ratified by the next generation of Americans because who has more excuse to rewrite a constitution than a generation of Americans from the 21st century?Note, I‚Äôm 40 ounces into a Gentleman Jack Apple Whiskey just operations to put my mind at ease because I hate society as a whole in that I can not for the life of me understand why we still have founding documents that limit our potential for growth? It isn‚Äôt a living, breathing document after all. It is a set piece of writing that all other rewrites of deserve to be criticized solely off the principles of pre-longevity, while a ‚Äúpractical‚Äù interpretation would not do this because the most practical interpretation would to be to act with compliance of the Constitution.I see it like driving.

The Republican party and Trump chased away Republican voters as well as many independents as a result of incessant lies about the 2020 election results. The effort to suppress votes by people of color did not go unnoticed by people of color. The inevitable effect of these strategic moves was a wave of opportunities to vote (mostly an overwhelming response by Democrats) and demonstrates to black, brown, and other marginalized populations that their votes are critical and must therefore be protected at all costs. Young voters are appearing in record numbers. The consequence of voter suppression was the Florida loss of Trump to Biden by a significant number, something that was clearly expected but denied by Republicans. Demographics are moving in this country, and the Republican party seems hopelessly out of date and outnumbered. They have lost all credibility with respect to protecting the American tradition of free and fair elections. People need to think hard about their patriotism when they vote GOP. New non-gerrymandered districts will certainly make a dent in the hold that Republican gerrymandering has had on the GOP guided by Trump.

It's also easier to compare prices on items, and for me remember the price in the future. I maintain a running list of everything I am getting LOW on, so when I am ready to purchase, I open the list and see if there is anything I should order while I am at it. You can see what is on sale. And look at reviews. And of course read package labels. I push the button when stopping in the parking lot of the store, and give them my order number. Everything comes out to the car, I transfer it into the car, and the person helping me pushes the cart back into the building. All for the same low price of shopping yourself.

       "     'The phrase \"shall not be infringed\" appears to be quite clear and unambiguous to me.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), has recently ruled to define the term \"infringed\" and how it is applied to the 2nd amendment by way of examination of the dictionary definitions of the word at the time of the framing of the Bill of Rights. Similarities to the same word in foreign constitutions were rejected from consideration by the same ruling. Here are excerpts relevant to the point from the majority Opinion of Scalia.-It was a commonly used term at the time.-It was a term used to mean a complete negation of that right.-The word INFRINGED as used in the 2A.The majority upholds the significance of the original public meaning ‚Äú(2) To encroach upon in a way that violates law or the rights of another‚Äù of ‚Äúthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.‚Äù to support the propositions that the 2nd Amendment right is ‚Äúto be armed‚Äù and is ‚Äúindividaul right, unconnected to militia service‚Äù. From the majority Opinion of Scalia:-The prefatory statement of purpose.-The interpretation of its application to militia service by the anti-2A crowd.DISSENT. The interpretation of \"well regulated\"-I find the dissent of Stevens on the matter of the meaning of \"well regulated\" to be the least objectionable despite it still misses the point of the significance that the right is to be subject to no exception at all that would make it permissible to infringe.-The dissent of Stevens tries to claim the difference between the current definition of \"regulate/training\" and the \"well functioning/proficient\" definition. I think the better approach was to be found in the English definition of \"train\" being the definition most applied in context to militia military use and taking that definition also back to the 1780s to give sense of what was the commonly understood meaning. I think that incorporates the requirement of the 2nd amendment for \"a well-regulated militia\". The modern commonly understood meaning more appropriate to use in other instances such as a \"training program\", with the modern sense of meaning again an intrusion \"that violates law or the rights of another\" all being acceptable in light of the meaning of \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"-Seems to accept the right to armed self-defense (right to be armed) outside of militia service is recognised for citizens in states where they are explicitly protected by state law.-Seems to uphold the incorporation interpretation of 2A against the opposing view of us promoting the opposite of incorporation.I agree that the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights needed to be written down and to rely on the natural and pre-existing human right to armed self-defense without it notably spelled out in a declaration, bill of rights or constitution is to leave the door open by not holding the bar up on the matter (favourable political climate required to have a better chance to hold onto the firearms status quo). Likely much less chance of chance of reaching the Heller case without it. And of course, an armed populous helps those in other countries better off than in Nth Korea ect to oust their tyrannical governments.',\n",

Why do you think the voting machines never have been changed.http://www.columbiadailyherald.com/news/20180306/maury-county-election-commission-to-kennedy-fraudulent-votes-cast-against-you We had a horrible time getting the vote machines set up last time. They even tried to refuse to hand out sample ballots so you could see how the machine worked. Then they tried to tell my friend and I that our ballots did not go through!!! I never left the poll without doing a number between 1 and 3 on my ballot to show which time I voted. They could not show me proof that my number one and only vote had been recorded. Just said that the machine had jammed up at that time. The state finally made them let us record our ballots manually when they threatened to not certify their election. Usually you have to ask at the front desk for a sample ballot. Starting this year they agreed after a lot of fuss to make a poster of the sample ballots available. Representative notary guy refused to answer any questions. I think the lady with my sample ballot finally hid it in a drawer. They will ask you at the front desk who you are going to vote for. 1988 Chan Gailey Bill Clinton 1989 John Majors George Bush Sr. 1992-2016 Lots of campaigning for God and prayer, then a threat to rip me off concerning my job at the state if I reported child abuse by welfare case workers. Lots of campaigning for Trump this around. Some weird stuff going on in the Deep State. Alex Jones made a satanic god child sex sacrifice program porn opera movie. Donald Trump was investigated cause he was supposedly a Russian spy and because of Ukraine. http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200817-the-ones-that-got-away-documenting-persecution-in-the-soviet-union  Schuyler Colfax - Speaker of the House 1862‚Äì1869 John Nance Garner - Speaker of the House 1931‚Äì1933 Vice President 1933‚Äì1941  AL Gortex Gore- Vice President (I want to slit your throat.

Israel offered Lyndonless Satanic Bumhole Johnson 1 million dollars to stop their invasion of Egypt. 3 years later Israel has Lyndons back cause they know that he had the Nuclear option. Alex Jones strikes again. Alex now says all that crap he put out about Roger Rapist Stone being a Saint were just a \"cover\". Alex also claimed for weeks that Laptop from Hell Hunter Pimp Biden was really Biden tryin to spy on the Wuhan Bio Lab. I\\'m wondering since Steve pissyourbuttigieg ran the Wuhan Bio Lab with under age sex slave money from Jeffrey masturbatory Epstein, if Steve pee on the bed didn\\'t send a Bio Weapon our way so he could sell out the whole US to China.columbiadailyherald.com  Is there one person who keeps switching from one party to another in order to vote for himself?  I want to vote for someone who has the courage to champion the idea that it would be wrong to have him thrown in jail for voting for himself. Sounds pretty petty to me to have someone thrown in jail for trying to see that the law is enforced. I found the perfect election for this one. viningslakechurch.com  There was one white guy who ran, in a primary I think. He had his picture and name on a bunch of billboards, which were later taken down. All the black people were aghast that he would spend money on a campaign. They asked him if he would help out the community. He told them no. That\\'s not how government works. Then he proceeded to cuss them out and drive off. Perfect man for an office nobody should have any power over anybody else until Trump took office.http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/facebook-erases-trump-boasting-he-would-have-run-into-florida-school-to-save-students/  They sure kept me from gettin a job after he took office. I would like to know why I can\\'t shoot him? I think it would be cause an allied bum from daily defense gets to stay bumming. I think we shoulda indulged in some buggery.https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/president-obama-meets-google-complete-serfs/ Sounds like something accomplished after hours at the Deep State Freak Fest. Need to ask Barry while he is hoofing it with his hoes. I had a bumper sticker that said \"I\\'m Puerto Rican\". Then Juan Lent MeZol told me this \"I\\'m Puerto Rican and from Puerto Rico and I come to America and I only see 1 set of balls and it was yours\". I think my neighbor was humpin the dummy on the porch. Alex Jones has probably revolutionized the martial arts business. He\\'s helped everybody evolve to the point where things are finally ready to be piped down the old rusty stink pipe. One lady told me that she heard on Gays Radio that 2 men can not catch aids!!!! I drew up the papers that woulda made me a transgender Muslim Indian chief. The 2 I asked to provide me with the proof that woulda won me the thing never got back with me. I think I\\'ll try and do them on the quick here in a little while. If that towelheads say anything about the wrong address then I\\'ll say that I\\'m not paying because they blamed my pictures with the polo shirt on. I think most of em are racists but they hide it pretty well in the pamphlets.  I saw the guy eye my dog and I think he sent the dog walkers over. I made the claim that I have Allahu Akbared over 100 times in the last hour. They said they would call the cops. Then left. Alluh Faggot.  Obama taught me that only you should get to run victims over for gun control reasons. If it is for a burqa law then you should be able to tell everyone to write my name down on their wall. They went and got a hermaphrodite nurse to help with the bathing since they claim to know alot about that subject from when they helped put all those homos on the immuno-supressive meds. Turned out that the guy and girl in bed.actually used it.  My pops told me a guy named Mike Turner was running for sheriff this time. You should try and get him to stop.  Maybe you can tell Hunter Beijin what these people do to people for making you mess up. Kick em in the ribs. Call them assholes. Then squirt em with a squirt bottle of water. What was the top three again? One of them I thought was going to be Kevin Rolls with he Edlebrock heads. Scott came in at number 2 cause he gave me a good price on some Castrol dang quick lube don\\'t do it at the Polar Bear Cottontop Winter Bumlymptic Oil. I\\'m happy with the result of the brawl. I went to work Berry limpy stock and came out with Porkey the Bloater.  I took Briggs to buy his are eight an a house to rent out about 12 years ago. He\\'s been subcontracting and iversnow.torAbout then so he can avoid getting old to ever since. He seems to love his job. You must be paying real good. I don\\'t blame you for comin and putting up with them so close by. I would land someplace close by myself.   When I sued Memphis I thought I was the man.  Now I\\'ve layed back down with my buddy the pillow. The one I used to hump. I took up whackin off recently. I think it\\'s from all the time I spent truck driving.  trying to do a guilty plea that has an error on it. They\\'re either going to send me a corrected one, or they\\'ll just shoot a nerve or somethin. I\\'ve been gettin pretty good at chucklin. If it is trumps fault then why don\\'t I try and plead guilty to having voted for him so I can spend the weekend partying and still make it to court on Monday. Obama went golfing, me and my cousin can go partying.  I\\'m going back to hollering at them in my own home. Want to hear the dumbest thing ever, especially after I just had a visit from our future President. I was the Sports Groups MVP Helper.  Did all the grunt work. Never got any recognition. They don\\'t award a helper. You are just a helper to the person or persons who get the award. Je got it. On paper I\\'m his personal helper. Helps that I\\'ve been known to hang around at times in a new town or campground for weeks with nobody to do a thing for me. Easier to ignore someone if you already have been giving them the cold shoulder.  That\\'s one time a bum from \\'Da Projects had the upper hand on me. Walking home from the save a quarter for another killer donut the sewer flooded over. Deep State freaks swang in and pole smoked at the leader of the freaks 123 times. Handler held talks with the outhouse. Then freaked and tried to call a hit on him after a few others smacked and screamed at the freak. They all ended up at the Priory. Except for the one who broke into the place and raped the outhouse.  Deep State covers their tracks cause they know they are wrong. Earlier in the ride a guy pulled out of his driveway leading the parade. He tried to strap me with a charge of incorrect change again to start the race. He just caused me to go straight on the first lap. The judge woulda threw it out cause the .20 change was the most expensive thing on the lot. Deep State freaks may never give me the apology I deserve but I had multiplied points with the Goddess of Love.https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/15/anthony-wiener-confirms-political-sex-motivation-/  We shoulda bumped chests or done some ji f king after we were done.  Might have done some kareoke when Obama was going to kill them            My monkey fuckfoot cousins hair is all windblown from spasming. Cause I took him in after a car wreck. Hows that!!! Got any plans for this afternoon from when I poop and take a nose hair trim and burn some garbage? Good yes or oh damn sure you will here in a few minutes. I have two personal helpers. Little Tom Shineball and Tommy Moon the poop cleaner. Tommy Lou probably only bums. He probably doesn\\'t bum with Tommy. I\\'ve missed ouch 900 dollars and he finally wined to me the humanness of it all. Then he helped me here a couple days ago.  He was drunk and came at me  with the butt end of a rake. I hopped the fence pretty gracefully. Comes in here last night tries to take my sticks and is trying to slap me with a charge of dui in the am. Then he comes back after he thinks I\\'m sleep and takes my sticks anyway. I get up and they are gone. I walk out and see him talking to the people in the dumpster. We have a quick discussion. They are Virtual  Narcotics Anonymous.  They feel betrayed by the V and me because we encouraged  Tommy. I say you and the bum threw that bum shit at the V. He was trying to help.  They were all sweaty and gross and rubbing their heads and different parts. Then they said the bum was a part of  their group. I asked him  if he wanted to see me get kidnapped so he could see me get raped. Tommy Lou says yes. Album Acaid Back is gonna be uploaded. This demo was too. Was at youtube and it was two expenses.  Album not for commerce was one. I  led them think they had stumbled on to something manic. Then I\\'m starting to watch Obama and my tax return comes in. I asked the bank lady  I think I should go ahead and pay  them. She handed me my slip.  I folded it. Stapled it. Put it in the envelope. Went and paid though    They were just going to turn around and take it out of my next one. If you had this supposed deal that I would get to stay here, then you coulda took them and got me moved out of here and kept the rest for your trouble.  I didn\\'t even go hoopin and hollerin but I\\'m thinking of takin the weekend off to rest my ears.  Terry Geek Steed               I couldn\\'t figure if I belonged in Tennessee or  Alabama. Gite showed his  racism to me on the phone. Johnny loves  me. I couldn\\'t believe that Gite at first was that racist to where he would let my sister move the bum in with him and not me. He  told my dad that after I told him. Johnny got on his ass  about discriminating against me because of my diblility and that he used to be on drugs and had a felony. So now he  lets me use deeds name. Plus he probably thinks I don\\'t use them. Because I don\\'t use Barry\\'s.Failure  to Communicate.Advertisement   Omari.  Dave tells me I\\'m not welcome. Can\\'t talk to him off of recess. Gains makes it 2 punch last year. I walk in and the skeleton head I guess of the animal I killed is right there in front of me. Last time I was over I looked up and there was a creepy calendar with women in old time bikinis. I look beside the desk and there\\'s a music stand with a picture of the bums head. Couldn\\'t help but to think WTF. As soon as they sell you throw him out on to the sidewalk. His Kosovan buddy heard my question and told me he was praying for mushrooms in his backyard. He started talking names and when we got to Barad-dur I tried to nudge him that it\\'s impossible to fit that many prayer plants and a volcano in a backyard. Another bummer named Mask came waltzing in to the Immigration Office and declared that he was gay.https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/14/bill-clinton-afghan-mujahideen-sexual-assault-war-crimes/He was then informed by the judge that he would be moved up in my spot. They took him before me but I did get in front of Bruce Spring-Jewist beforehand. Had to teach the judge that the guy following me was a gangbanger. I reassured the judge that I had seen it in the movie Colors. Being a Borderjumper my lawyer gave hisysay so they handed him a check.   Tells  me he has a vision that Ff Covid 19 has passed. I give him the papers that I did 80 years in jail for peeing on the bed and the murdernthe next day of six guys. Took the papers with him. I\\'m moderator1 at youtube. Hope their not hiding anything.  Maybe I have the password by the time nothing happens. Started shittin talk. He takes them. Org. He gets back. I have to go. He makes a boner joke to somebody down the hall. Then the cop wakes me up for the shower. Points to the cop. Says he\\'s going to get me for menacing to office. He has seemed to have repented since he was going to run me to the house down by the pizza joint with the cop car while the flattop was going to check the other blue car. Now I will move to that house if you can boner him the right way. He\\'s a police officer not a psychologist you. Hear him in the office getting  ready for the fight. Dummy ends up in jail, I end up in jail quite a few times because of him.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/obama-book-backlash-transgender-activists-b1748423.html  Then for the first 2 weeks he gives me a little holler or two but basically leaves me alone. I dropped the gay thing as an angle and went balls to the wall with crazy. They sided with me at the courthouse and asked him if he would be my mental awareness percussionist. The whole time you\\'re still going balls in the hole. Don\\'t wanta cut off and have the court just give home house arrest. Yeah I did it and I shouldn\\'t have but these people did this to me. He kept hollering you said it was me! I told him you can sit in the corner with the girl on lovely grear.com. He said I\\'m not ailing at the website. I said yes you brought the papers to the hearing and that you didn\\'t see anything. They always show the pictures of the suspects while it is hollered at interviewer a how many are me. Now I\\'m back in here would Arkansas license plates.  Johnny keeps hollering shut up Terry.  Johnny claimed I was breathing rite up in his face  yesterday.           Got some flea market alarms here that I\\'m gonna sell Johnny if you don\\'t play your cards right tonight.  Have a pleasant weekend.  Start the album Friday if you have to. Load the videos next. There won\\'t be any sign right now that it is self defense. Hope that helps.  First it starts down in the bottom part of the engine.
