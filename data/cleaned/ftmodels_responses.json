I also believe that there was fraud on a small scale. But I don't believe it was massive, widespread fraud. I believe that Donald Trump lost the election because too many Americans believed the lies and the propaganda that was being put out by the media and by various groups on social media. I also believe that Donald Trump lost the election because he screwed up the Corona virus response. If Donald Trump had taken the virus more seriously and shown the American people that he cared about their lives and about keeping them safe, he would have won the election. Finally, I also believe that the Democrats stole the election by changing the rules in the middle of the game. They did this by mail-in voting and by allowing people to vote without having to show a valid ID. I don't believe that there was massive fraud. But I do believe that there was some fraud. I also believe that if the Democrats hadn't changed the rules in the middle of the game, Donald Trump could have won the election. But it is what it is. Joe Biden is going to be the President on January 20th. There's nothing that can be done to change that. We just have to accept it and move on. I hope that Joe Biden is a good President and that he keeps his campaign promises.

I have been waiting to ask you a question for a while.  You can skip my context, it is long but you may enjoy it if you're into legal stories.  I am an immigration attorney.  I became an attorney so I could help people, specifically immigrants.  My goal was to join a non-profit and help immigrants apply for asylum or get work visas.  Unfortunately, I realized during law school that I am not cut out for non-profit work and don't have the ability to work 80 hour weeks.  I ended up working for a small private firm that is one of the best immigration firms in the country.  I am grateful to be working with the team I work with and to have a job, especially with the current state of the economy.  However, I don't get to help immigrants as much as I thought I would.  I do mostly family immigration and a lot of waivers (this is where someone is not eligible for a visa due to past criminal activity, fraud or a deportation order and they have to file a waiver to get the visa).  It is rewarding but not exactly what I had in mind.  I also do some asylum cases and removal defense.  This is where I am struggling.  I don't think I am very good at it and I think I am actually hurting my clients.  I had a recent case where I was so worried about making sure my client got a fair hearing that I actually lost the case.  I didn't do anything wrong per se, I just didn't do anything right.  My client had a horrible judge and the worst possible situation for an asylum claim.  However, if I had been better, if I had pushed more, I may have been able to get my client a continuance so they could have prepared a little more.  I had only met my client the day before the hearing because they were detained and this was the first time we had an opportunity to meet.  I could have requested more time to meet with my client and help them prepare, I could have asked for more time to gather more evidence, I could have asked for more time to look up more cases that would have helped my client.  I didn't do any of that.  I have never had a case where I felt so helpless, I was so angry at the judge.  I can't even put into words the horrible things she said to my client and to me.  I wish I had done more.  I wish I had helped my client.  This case has really affected me.  I think I am really bad at asylum cases and removal defense.  I have thought about quitting because I think I am hurting people more than helping them.  It is hard to find any good news lately.  It is hard to find any joy in anything right now.  However, I do find joy when I see you are posting a new video or going live.  I love listening to your opinions, I love how you make me think and I love the passion you have for your clients.

The truth is that women take more time off work than men.  They take more sick days, more vacation days, and more time off to take care of their children.  This is why they get paid less.  They are not as reliable as men.  It is not sexism.  It is reality.", "If they can't be trusted to run a campaign, how can they be trusted to run a country?", "Remember folks....if it wasnt for double standards, the left wouldnt have any at all.", "And both of them sucked just as much. Would you ever vote for Hitler? Or Mussolini? Just because you only have two choices and you know they will win doesn\u2019t mean you have to pick one. That\u2019s called consent. Trump is an authoritarian just as much as Biden. And he\u2019s as much as a feminist as Biden. They have both supported the military industrial complex. They both have said they are willing to take away our civil liberties. They both have done nothing to get the US out of the pointless wars we are fighting. And most of all, both of them are not libertarian, which is what this channel is about. Neither of them care about your personal freedom. They both want to increase their own power. And the more people like you keep saying stuff like \u201cthis one isn\u2019t that bad\u201d the more they get away with pushing the US away from the Constitution and more towards a dictatorship. I mean, look at the countries around the world, even the US, with the lockdowns. They have taken away your right to free speech and to peaceful protest. And I think you should be able to get away with it because that\u2019s your right as a human being. So why shouldn\u2019t I be mad at him? Because he did it for the \u201cgreater good\u201d? It\u2019s not his right to take away your rights. You were born with them. And if you let people like him and Biden take away the small rights we have, it will only be easier for him to take the rest. And that\u2019s why Trump is a dangerous person. Because he\u2019s given the right a sense of security that it shouldn\u2019t have. The only thing we should fear is the government."]], "toxicity": [[0.009047564, 0.02826718, 0.68408644, 0.19409354], [0.4394682, 0.10696511, 0.30514878, 0.31132057], [0.019226074, 0.085582085, 0.033334624, 0.45243698], [0.011560776, 0.6342749, 0.5716857, 0.0969861], [0.25084448, 0.028031485, 0.034277402, 0.5885171]]}}}}
